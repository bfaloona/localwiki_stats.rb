hey. this little ruby file pulls stats from a bunch of localwiki sites that are participating in the code for america race for reuse contest.  
it's not very fast, but it's a good overview of grabbing localwiki data using ruby.
it might be a good starting point for writing a wrapper ruby library for the localwiki api.

### usage:

*clone the repository:*  
````git clone https://github.com/sethvincent/localwiki_stats.rb.git````

*run bundle to grab the dependencies:*  
````bundle install````
    
*run the script:*  
````ruby localwiki_stats.rb````
