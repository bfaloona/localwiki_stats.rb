hey. this little ruby file pulls stats from a bunch of localwiki sites that are participating in the code for america race for reuse contest.  
it's not very fast, but it's a good overview of grabbing localwiki data using ruby.
it might be a good starting point for writing a wrapper ruby library for the localwiki api.
